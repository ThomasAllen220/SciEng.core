Title:
SciEng.Core – Applied Engineering & Physics Utilities

Why this exists

SciEng.Core provides explicit, unit-safe utilities for early-stage engineering and scientific calculations.
It is intended for fast design exploration and workflow automation, not as a replacement for full FEM/CFD solvers.

Design principles

Explicit physical assumptions

No hidden units or magic numbers

APIs designed for scientists and engineers

Clear separation between physics and numerics
